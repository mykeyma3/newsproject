Tonight’s precipitation chances increase, and as temperatures drop toward freezing, some of the showers may transition into snow showers.\n\n## Why it matters\nEven light snow can create slick spots on bridges, ramps, and untreated side streets—especially overnight into the early morning when surface temps are lowest.\n\n## What to watch\nWatch for brief bursts of snow mixing in late tonight, then colder highs over the weekend. If you’ll be driving early Saturday, check road conditions for any patchy slick areas.",

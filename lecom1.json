The request outlines a split use: school land plus future residential/development acreage.\n\n## Why it matters\nAnnexations like this shape the metro’s next wave of housing supply and public infrastructure. When school sites are planned alongside new development, it can reduce later bottlenecks (overcrowding, transport strain) and make growth more predictable for builders and families.\n\n## What to watch\nWatch the January 22 council vote and any follow-on planning milestones (zoning, infrastructure phasing, and timelines for the school build).",

The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%.\n\n## Why it matters\nPayroll growth is one of the cleanest “real economy” signals. A slower pace can reduce inflation pressure through demand and wages, which can influence the Federal Reserve’s path for interest rates.\n\n## What to watch\nNext month’s revisions and the trend across multiple reports matter more than a single reading. Pay attention to whether slowing hiring broadens across industries and whether wage growth cools further.",

Even small shifts in expected timing can move yields, the dollar, and risk assets.\n\n## What to watch\nUpcoming inflation and growth data will likely matter more than any single labor report.
